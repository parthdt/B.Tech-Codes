		In linear search, since there are  at max t keys (t=2*n -1), if we implement linear search - 
		
		time complexity = O(no. of items)
				    = O(2n-1)
				    =O(n)
				    
		In bin. search, - 
		
		time complexity = O(log(no. of items)
				    = O(log(2n-1))
				    = O(log(n))
				    
				    
		Here, t=2t-1, but if t was f(n), in bin. search, TC = O(log(f(n)) = O(log(n)). So, independant of how t is chosen.
