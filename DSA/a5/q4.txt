	Algorithm for inorder traversal without recursion and stack is something called Morris Traversal. Algo is as follows - 
	 
	 
	 1) Initialize current node as the root  
	 2) While current node is not NULL    
		
		If current node does not have a left child       

			a) Print currentâ€™s data       
			b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
		Else       
			a) Make current as right child of the rightmost node in current's left subtree       
			b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
